# Nx In This Monorepo

Nx is the task orchestration and local caching layer for this pnpm workspace. It
sits on top of the existing tooling — `tsdown`, `electron-vite`, `vitest`, `oxlint`,
`oxfmt` — and adds dependency-ordered execution, input hashing, and output caching
without requiring any structural changes to packages.

No `project.json` files exist. Nx infers all nine projects from `package.json`
`workspace:*` dependencies and runs each project's existing `package.json` scripts
as Nx targets.

## Project Graph

Nx derives this graph from `workspace:*` dependency references:

```
@emdash/shared             (leaf)
@emdash/wire               -> shared
@emdash/core               -> shared, wire
@emdash/runtime            -> core, shared, wire
@emdash/plugins            -> core, runtime, shared, wire
@emdash/chat-ui            -> core, shared
@emdash/ui                 -> chat-ui, shared
@emdash/workspace-server   -> core, plugins, runtime, shared, wire
@emdash/emdash-desktop     -> chat-ui, core, plugins, runtime, shared, ui, wire
```

The `dependsOn: ["^build"]` default in `nx.json` means "build all upstream packages
before running this target." A bare `nx build @emdash/emdash-desktop` therefore
builds all of its upstream workspace dependencies first, in dependency order, with
parallelism where the graph allows.

## Common Commands

All of these run from the repo root.

**Run a target for every project:**

```bash
pnpm run build          # nx run-many -t build --all
pnpm run test           # nx run-many -t test --all
pnpm run lint           # nx run-many -t lint --all
pnpm run typecheck      # nx run-many -t typecheck --all
pnpm run format:check   # nx run-many -t format:check --all
pnpm run format         # nx run-many -t format --all
pnpm run docs:check     # validate agent docs without Nx
```

**Start the full dev setup:**

```bash
pnpm run dev            # nx run-many -t dev --all --parallel=10
```

This builds upstream packages via the `dev -> ^build` dependency chain, then starts
all `dev` targets (tsdown watches + electron-vite dev) in parallel.

**Run only affected projects (relative to the default base branch):**

```bash
pnpm run affected       # nx affected -t lint typecheck test
```

**Visualize the project graph:**

```bash
pnpm run graph          # opens nx graph in the browser
```

**Address a single project or target directly:**

```bash
nx build @emdash/core
nx test @emdash/shared
nx typecheck @emdash/emdash-desktop
nx package:mac @emdash/emdash-desktop
nx db:reset @emdash/emdash-desktop
nx storybook @emdash/ui
nx build:theme @emdash/ui
```

**Run affected with a custom base:**

```bash
nx affected -t lint typecheck --base=main --head=HEAD
```

**List all projects:**

```bash
nx show projects
```

**Inspect a project's resolved targets:**

```bash
nx show project @emdash/core
nx show project @emdash/emdash-desktop
```

## Task Ordering

Nx uses the `dependsOn` declarations in `nx.json` to determine task order:

| Target         | Waits for upstream `build` first? | Cached? |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------- |
| `build`        | yes (`^build`)                    | yes     |
| `typecheck`    | yes (`^build`)                    | yes     |
| `test`         | yes (`^build`)                    | yes     |
| `dev`          | yes (`^build`)                    | no      |
| `lint`         | no                                | yes     |
| `format:check` | no                                | yes     |
| `format`       | no                                | no      |

Targets not listed in `targetDefaults` (e.g. `package`, `rebuild`, `db:reset`,
`db:generate`) remain inferred package-script targets but receive no shared dependency-ordering or
caching defaults.

## Local Caching

Nx hashes each task's inputs — source files, config files, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and
`sharedGlobals` (`.oxlintrc.json`, `.oxfmtrc.json`) — and caches the output
artifacts and terminal output in `.nx/cache/`. A cache hit replays the output
instantly without re-running the task.

Cached output directories per project:
- `packages/*/dist/` — tsdown output
- `apps/emdash-desktop/out/` — electron-vite build output

**What is NOT cached** (intentionally, due to platform/environment sensitivity):
- `package`, `package:mac`, `package:linux`, `package:win` — electron-builder
  produces native platform artifacts and handles its own incremental logic.
- `rebuild` — Electron native module rebuild depends on the local Electron ABI.
- `run:docker-ssh`, `db:generate`, `db:reset` — side-effecting operations.
- `dev`, `format` — long-running or write-output operations.

**Bust the cache when needed:**

```bash
nx reset              # clears .nx/cache and .nx/workspace-data
```

The `.nx/` directory is gitignored and local to each machine.

## CI Integration

The `code-consistency-check.yml` workflow uses `nrwl/nx-set-shas@v4` to set
`NX_BASE` and `NX_HEAD` environment variables from the PR base and head SHAs, then
runs:

```bash
pnpm nx affected -t format:check typecheck lint
pnpm nx affected -t test
```

This means only the projects touched by the PR (and their dependents) are checked or tested.
A PR that modifies only `packages/ui` will not re-run typecheck for the desktop app
unless it actually depends on changed output.

The `fetch-depth: 0` checkout is required for `nx-set-shas` to walk the full commit
history and determine which files changed relative to the base branch.

## Adding a New Package

When a new package is added under `packages/` or `apps/` that follows the same
script conventions (`build`, `test`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `format`, `format:check`),
Nx automatically picks it up at the next run. No `nx.json` changes are needed unless
the package needs non-default caching behavior (unusual output paths, skipped cache,
or a different `dependsOn`).

To override defaults for a specific project, add a `"nx"` key to that package's
`package.json`:

```json
{
  "nx": {
    "targets": {
      "build": {
        "outputs": ["{projectRoot}/dist", "{projectRoot}/types"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
