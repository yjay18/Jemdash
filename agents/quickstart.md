# Quickstart

## Toolchain

- Node: `24.14.0` from `.nvmrc`
- Package manager: `pnpm@10.28.2`
- Workspace layout: pnpm monorepo; the Electron app lives in `apps/emdash-desktop/`

## Core Commands

Run from `apps/emdash-desktop/` (the root `package.json` also provides `dev` and `build`
aggregates that delegate via `pnpm --filter`):

```bash
pnpm run d
pnpm run dev
pnpm run dev:main
pnpm run dev:renderer
pnpm run build
pnpm run rebuild
pnpm run reset
```

## Validation Commands

Run from the repo root (they fan out to the workspace) or from `apps/emdash-desktop/`:

```bash
pnpm run format
pnpm run lint
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run test
pnpm run docs:check
```

## Important Notes

- Read root `ROADMAP.md` before feature work and update its checklist when the feature's full
  acceptance criteria pass.
- After native dependency changes (`better-sqlite3`, `node-pty`), run `pnpm run rebuild`.
- There are no pre-commit hooks; run the validation commands before opening or merging a PR.
- Use the repository skill `$emdash-validate-change` to choose focused checks before the broader
  gate.
